Indiana Jones and the Call of Thunder
=====================================
The original team (Dominik Haslinger, Jens Doblies and Sebastien Ronsse) did the majority of the work.  
It was originally intended to be a much longer game, but I (Jennifer McMurray) finished up the ice  
cavern sequence so that it could be released as I thought it would be a shame if no one got to play it.  
Their sourcecode was playable up to the point where you complete the mechanism in the cavern.  
Here are the changes and fixes that I made to that source code:

-Replaced LucasArts logo with a ScummGen logo.
-Made a few grammar corrections to the original script.
-Created icons for inventory items that lacked them (all instances of the stones and the gas can).
-Programmed an if/then statement regarding the gas can that was referenced but not implemented in the source.
-Fix the mechanism puzzle to require both objects, as before it was possible to complete it with only one object.
-Add dialog to facilitate the change in the mechanism puzzle.
-Fix the lighting so that the cavern stays lit when you move to the cavern entrance and back.
-Enable the usage of the item used to exit the cavern, as referenced but not implemented in the source.
-Change description of the macguffin as it was originally used as a joke related to the game being unfinished (but kept it humourous to suit the tone of the original).
-Add dialog necessary for the ending sequence.
-Add end screen.
